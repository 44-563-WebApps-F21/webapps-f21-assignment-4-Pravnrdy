<h5 class="robertchiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>  <p class="speech">What!  Had I fallen so low in your eyes that you
    thought that even for a moment I could have doubted your goodness?
    Gertrude, Gertrude, you are to me the white image of all good things, and
    sin can never touch you.  Arthur, you can go to Mabel, and you have my
    best wishes!  Oh! stop a moment.  There is no name at the beginning of
    this letter.  The brilliant Mrs. Cheveley does not seem to have noticed
    that.  There should be a name.</p>
    
   <h5 class="ladychiltern">LADY CHILTERN.</h5>  <p class="speech">Let me write yours.  It is you I trust and need.  You and
    none else.</p>
    
    <h5 class="lordgoring">LORD GORING.</h5> <p class="speech">Well, really, Lady Chiltern, I think I should have back my
    own letter.</p>
