<h4>Act II.  _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_. <br>Description:[LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
    armchair_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_.
    _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_.
    _As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]</h4>     
<p>LORD GORING.  [_In his most earnest manner_.]  Oh! please don’t.  It is
    so pretty.  One of the prettiest hats I ever saw.  I hope the Woman’s
    Liberal Association received it with loud applause.<br>
    <br>
    LADY CHILTERN.  [_With a smile_.]  We have much more important work to do
    than look at each other’s bonnets, Lord Goring.<br>
    <br>
    LORD GORING.  Really?  What sort of work?<br>
    <br>
    LADY CHILTERN.  Oh! dull, useful, delightful things, Factory Acts, Female
    Inspectors, the Eight Hours’ Bill, the Parliamentary Franchise. . . .
    Everything, in fact, that you would find thoroughly uninteresting.<br>
    <br>
    LORD GORING.  And never bonnets?<br>
    <br>
    LADY CHILTERN.  [_With mock indignation_.]  Never bonnets, never!<br>
    <br>
    [LADY CHILTERN _goes out through the door leading to her boudoir_.]<br>
    <br>
    SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Takes_ LORD GORING’S _hand_.]  You have been a
    good friend to me, Arthur, a thoroughly good friend.<br>
    <br>
    LORD GORING.  I don’t know that I have been able to do much for you,
    Robert, as yet.  In fact, I have not been able to do anything for you, as
    far as I can see.  I am thoroughly disappointed with myself.<br>
    <br>
    SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You have enabled me to tell you the truth.  That is
    something.  The truth has always stifled me.</p>
