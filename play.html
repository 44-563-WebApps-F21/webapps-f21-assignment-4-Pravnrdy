<h4>Act II.  _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_. <br>Description:[LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
    armchair_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_.
    _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_.
    _As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]</h4>     
    <span href="#" class="icon"></span><h5 class="lordgoring">LORD GORING.</h5> <p id="stage-direction">[_In his most earnest manner_.]</P> <P id="speech">Oh! please don’t.  It is
    so pretty.  One of the prettiest hats I ever saw.  I hope the Woman’s
    Liberal Association received it with loud applause.</p> 
    <span href="#" class="icon"></span><h5 class="ladychiltern">LADY CHILTERN.</h5> <p id="stage-direction">[_With a smile_.]</p>   <P id="speech">We have much more important work to do
        than look at each other’s bonnets, Lord Goring.</P>
    <span href="#" class="icon"></span><h5 class="lordgoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  <P id="speech">Really?  What sort of work?</P>
    <span href="#" class="icon"></span><h5 class="ladychiltern">LADY CHILTERN.</h5>  <P id="speech">Oh! dull, useful, delightful things, Factory Acts, Female
    Inspectors, the Eight Hours’ Bill, the Parliamentary Franchise. . . .
    Everything, in fact, that you would find thoroughly uninteresting.</P>
    <span href="#" class="icon"></span><h5 class="lordgoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  <P id="speech">And never bonnets?</P>
    <span href="#" class="icon"></span><h5 class="ladychiltern">LADY CHILTERN.</h5>  <P id="stage-direction">[_With mock indignation_.]</P>  <P id="speech">Never bonnets, never!</P>
    <P id="stage-direction">[LADY CHILTERN _goes out through the door leading to her boudoir_.]</P>
    <span href="#" class="icon"></span><h5 class="robertchiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>  <P id="stage-direction">[_Takes_ LORD GORING’S _hand_.]</P>  <P id="speech">You have been a
        good friend to me, Arthur, a thoroughly good friend.</P>
    <span href="#" class="icon"></span><h5 class="lordgoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  <P id="speech">I don’t know that I have been able to do much for you,
        Robert, as yet.  In fact, I have not been able to do anything for you, as
        far as I can see.  I am thoroughly disappointed with myself.</P>
    <span href="#" class="icon"></span><h5 class="robertchiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>  <P id="speech">You have enabled me to tell you the truth.  That is
        something.  The truth has always stifled me.</P>
